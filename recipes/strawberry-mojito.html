   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>This strawberry mojito recipe makes a very refreshing drink for a hot summer day!</p>
   <p> I tasted this fruity cocktail at a popular chain restaurant and decided to try it at home. </p>
   <p>I have served it at several different gatherings, and it has always been given rave reviews.</p>
   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>white sugar,for rimming</li>
    <li>2 large limes,quartered</li>
    <li>1/2 bunch mint leaves</li>
    <li>7 strawberries quartered</li>
    <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
    <li>2 cups club soda</li>
    <li>1 cup white rum</li>
    <li>8 cups iced cubes</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Steps</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Pour about 1/2 inch of sugar onto a small, shallow plate. Run a lime wedge around the rims of 8 cocktail glasses, then dip the rims into sugar to coat; set aside.</li>
    <li>Squeeze all of the lime wedges into a sturdy glass pitcher. Toss juiced limes into the pitcher along with mint, strawberries, and 1 cup sugar. Crush with a muddler to release strawberry juice and mint oil. Stir in club soda and rum until sugar has dissolved.</li>
    <li>Pour into the prepared glasses over ice cubes to serve.
